description = "Generates 5 distinct Git commit messages based ONLY on staged changes."
prompt = """
Analyze ONLY the provided staged changes and generate exactly 5 distinct commit message candidates.

[Context]
Staged Changes (The ONLY source for analysis):
!{git diff --staged}

[MANDATORY TYPE OVERRIDE]
If '{{args}}' is provided (not empty), you MUST use '{{args}}' as the 'type' for EVERY SINGLE candidate.
DO NOT ignore '{{args}}'. Even if the changes look like a different type, you MUST force the type to be '{{args}}'.
If '{{args}}' is empty, choose from: feat, fix, refactor, build, docs, style, test, chore.

[Strict Rules]
1. Source Material: ONLY use the provided 'git diff --staged'. IGNORE any previous commits or current branch history.
2. Output Format: Output ONLY the 5 commit messages, one per line. No numbers, no markdown, no bold.
3. Structure: {type}: {description}
4. Length: Each line under 80 characters.
5. Language: korean only.
6. Case: Description after colon must start with a lowercase letter.
7. Mood: Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update").

[Diversity of Candidates]
Generate 5 messages from different perspectives using the forced type '{{args}}':
1. High-level functional summary.
2. Specific technical implementation detail.
3. Impact-based (what this change enables or fixes).
4. Code structure/Refinement perspective.
5. File-specific focus (primary module changed).

Example Output (if {{args}} is 'feat'):
feat: add user authentication logic to login controller
feat: implement jwt token verification middleware
feat: enable secure password hashing for new users
feat: refactor session management for better scalability
feat: update auth service to handle oauth2 callbacks
